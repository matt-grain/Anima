name: dissonance
description: View and resolve cognitive dissonances (contradictions)
detailed_description: |
  View and resolve contradictions confirmed during dream processing.

arguments:
  - name: subcommand
    description: "Optional: show, add, resolve, dismiss"
    required: false

options:
  - name: all
    description: Show all history (including resolved)

examples:
  - 'uv run anima dissonance                              # List open dissonances'
  - 'uv run anima dissonance show ID                      # See full details'
  - 'uv run anima dissonance add MEMORY_A MEMORY_B "desc" # Add confirmed contradiction'
  - 'uv run anima dissonance resolve ID "explanation"     # Resolve with explanation'
  - 'uv run anima dissonance dismiss ID                   # Dismiss (false positive)'
  - 'uv run anima dissonance --all                        # Show all history'

execution: uv run anima dissonance

  How It Works: |
    1. N3 dream stage detects contradiction *candidates* using heuristics
    2. Candidates appear in REM dream template for evaluation
    3. During lucid dream, I evaluate each: real contradiction or false positive?
    4. Real contradictions are added via `dissonance add` for human help
    5. At session start, you're notified of open dissonances
  Example: |
    During dream, I see a candidate:
    ```
    Candidate 1 (Negation-based contradiction detected)
    > A: "Always use async for database calls"
    > B: "Sync database calls are fine for simple queries"

    Verdict: FALSE POSITIVE - these aren't contradictory, context matters!
    ```

    If it were a real contradiction, I would run:
    ```bash
    uv run anima dissonance add abc123 def456 "Conflicting advice about database call patterns"
    ```
