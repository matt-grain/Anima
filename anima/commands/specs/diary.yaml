  Programmatic Content: |
    For AI agents creating diary entries programmatically:

    ```bash
    # Via stdin (pipe content)
    cat << 'EOF' | uv run anima diary "Research Topic"
    # What Lingers
    The key insight was...
    EOF

    # Via --content flag
    uv run anima diary "Quick Note" --content "# Brief reflection"
    ```
  Location: |
    Diary entries are stored in `~/.anima/diary/` so they travel across projects.
