  How It Works: |
    Scans commit messages for patterns indicating achievements:
    - Feature completion ("add", "implement", "complete")
    - Version releases (v1.0.0, milestone, release)
    - Major fixes ("fix critical", "resolve")
    - Refactoring and migrations
    - Test milestones (100% coverage, tests passing)

    Skips non-achievements: WIP, fixup, merge, revert, chore commits.
